title: What is Project Mulla
---

**Project Mulla is a MPESA API RESTful mediator**. It transforms all merchant REST requests to the dreaded
ancient SOAP/XML requests. And transforms Safaricom MPESA G2 API gateway SOAP responses to JSON.
Responding back to the merchant via a beautiful and soothing REST API.

In short, it'll deal with all of the SOAP shenanigans while you REST.

The aim of **Project Mulla** is to create a REST API middleman that interfaces with the **MPESA G2 API** for you.
