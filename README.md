# Project Mulla

__MPESA API Mediator__. Basically converts all merchant request to the
dreaded ancient SOAP/XML, mediating all communications to the SAG frictionlessly,
and responding to the merchant RESTfully.

Basically, the aim of __Project Mulla__, is to create a REST API that interfaces with the MPESA G2 API.

#### We Know, SOAP! Yuck!
Developers should not go through the __trauma__ involved with dealing with SOAP/XML in the 21st century.
