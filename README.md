# Project Mulla

__What MPESA G2 API should have been in the 21st century.__

__MPESA API RESTful mediator__. Basically converts all merchant requests to the dreaded ancient SOAP/XML 
requests. It then mediates all communications to and from the Safaricom MPESA gateway frictionlessly. 
Responding to the merchant via a beautiful and soothing 21st century REST API.

In short, it'll deal with all of the SOAP shinanigans while you REST.

The aim of __Project Mulla__, is to create a REST API that interfaces with the ugly MPESA G2 API.

Sounds like a broken reacord, but it was to emphasize what we hope to achieve :)

### Since We Know, SOAP! Yuck!

Developers should not go through the __trauma__ involved with dealing with SOAP/XML in the 21st century.

### This project uses GPL3 License

You saw the __LICENSE__ but you were like *TL;DR*. Here's a summary of what it entails:

```markdown
1. Because I want to, and if you disagree with it then don’t use my software. It’s as simple as that.

2. I almost need people, organisations and companies to have to admit they use my software.

3. I have no social incentive to "give" my software free companies just after nothing else but profit. 
Let's talk how I can profit too, if you decide to use my software.

4. I use GPL3 to keep you honest. You now have to tell your bosses you’re using my gear. 
And it will scare the shit out of them.

5. Because the companies who use our software do not give back. The irony of the situation is that, 
in order to improve my motivation to do open source, I have to charge for it.

6. I want people to appreciate the work I’ve done and the value of what I’ve made.
