# Project Mulla

__What MPESA G2 API should have been in the 21st century.__

__MPESA API RESTful mediator__. Basically converts all merchant requests to the dreaded ancient SOAP/XML
requests. It then mediates all communications to and from the Safaricom MPESA gateway frictionlessly.
Responding to the merchant via a beautiful and soothing 21st century REST API.

In short, it'll deal with all of the SOAP shenanigans while you REST. ðŸ˜„

The aim of __Project Mulla__, is to create a REST API that interfaces with the __ugly MPESA G2 API.__

### Yes We Know! SOAP! Yuck!

Developers should not go through the __trauma__ involved with dealing with SOAP/XML in the 21st century.

# Example of how it works

Once __Project Mulla__ is set up, up and running in whichever clould platform you prefer(we recommend `Heroku.com`). Your 1st request once your customer/client has consumed your services or purchasing products from you is to innitiate a payment request.

##### Initiate Payment Request:

_Method_: __`POST`__ 

_Endpoint_: __`https://awesome-service.com/api/v1/payment/request`__

_Parameters_:
- __`phoneNumber`__ - The phone number of your client
- __`totalAmount`__ - The total amount you are charging the client
- __`referenceID`__ - The reference ID of the order or service __[optional; one is provided for you if missing]__
- __`merchantTransactionID`__ - This specific order's or service's transaction ID __[optional; one is provided for you if missing]__

_Response:_
