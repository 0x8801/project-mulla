# Project Mulla

__What MPESA G2 API should have been in the 21st century.__

__MPESA API RESTful mediator__. Basically converts all merchant requests to the dreaded ancient SOAP/XML 
requests. It then mediates all communications to and from the Safaricom MPESA gateway frictionlessly. 
Responding to the merchant via a beautiful and soothing 21st century REST API.

In short, it'll deal with all of the SOAP shinanigans while you REST.

The aim of __Project Mulla__, is to create a REST API that interfaces with the ugly MPESA G2 API.

Sounds like a broken reacord, but it was to emphasize what we hope to achieve :)

### Since We Know, SOAP! Yuck!

Developers should not go through the __trauma__ involved with dealing with SOAP/XML in the 21st century.

### This project uses GPL3 LICENSE

You saw the __LICENSE__ but you were like __*TL;DR*__. Here's a summary of what it entails:

```markdown
1. If you disagree with it then don’t use my software. It’s as simple as that.

2. I almost need people, organisations and companies to have to admit they use my software.

3. I have no social incentive to "give" my software free to companies just after nothing else but profit. 
   Open source to open source, corporation to corporation.

4. To keep you honest. You now have to tell your bosses you’re using my gear. And it will scare 
   the shit out of them. Why? They risk opensourcing all of their codebase.

5. Some companies who use our software do not give back. The irony of the situation is that, 
   in order to improve my motivation to do open source, I have to charge for it.
