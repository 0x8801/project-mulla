# Project Mulla

__MPESA API Mediator__. Basically converts all merchant requests to the dreaded ancient SOAP/XML 
requests. It then mediating all communications from the Safaricom MPESA gateway frictionlessly. 
Responding to merchant via a beautiful and soothing REST API interface.

In short, we'll deal with all of the SOAP shinanigans while you REST.

The aim of __Project Mulla__, is to create a REST API that interfaces with the Ugly MPESA G2 API.

Sounded like a broken reacord, but it was to emphasize what we hope to archieve :)

#### Since We Know, SOAP! Yuck!
Developers should not go through the __trauma__ involved with dealing with SOAP/XML in the 21st century.
