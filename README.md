# Project Mulla

__What MPESA G2 API should have been in the 21st century.__

__MPESA API RESTful mediator__. Basically converts all merchant requests to the dreaded ancient SOAP/XML
requests. It then mediates all communications to and from the Safaricom MPESA gateway frictionlessly.
Responding to the merchant via a beautiful and soothing 21st century REST API.

In short, it'll deal with all of the SOAP shenanigans while you REST.

The aim of __Project Mulla__, is to create a REST API that interfaces with the ugly MPESA G2 API.

Sounds like a broken record, but it was to emphasize what we hope to achieve :)

### Since We Know, SOAP! Yuck!

Developers should not go through the __trauma__ involved with dealing with SOAP/XML in the 21st century.
